# airbnb_price_est
This project aims to help Airbnb hosts estimate the optimal listing price based on various property characteristics such as location, size, amenities, and more. By analyzing pre-scraped data from Airbnb, the model provides hosts with data-driven price recommendations to maximize their listing's profitability while staying competitive in the market.
